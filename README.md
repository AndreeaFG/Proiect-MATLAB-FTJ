# Proiect-MATLAB-FTJ

I developed an interactive graphical interface in Matlab to simulate an RC low-pass filter, allowing
users to visualize signal diagrams based on frequency and automatically calculate parameters such as
cutoff frequency and angular frequency. The project includes the use of GUI components (uicontrol,
uimenu, uibuttongroup) to create an intuitive menu, along with code integration for generating plots
and enabling user interaction. It combines basic concepts from electronics and Matlab programming,
as well as UX design principles for the menu layout.
